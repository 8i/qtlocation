    \brief The Flickr example shows how to use the user's current location to
           fetch local content from a web service.

    \image  qml-flickr-1.jpg

    The basic idea is to fetch public images from the Flickr service based on
    your current location. In case there is no default positioning provider on the platform
    the application is being run on, the example defaults to use a small NMEA log file
    (recorded in Australia).
