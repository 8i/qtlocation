\title QtLocation Module
\brief The QtLocation API provides location positioning, mapping, navigation and place search
       via QML and C++ interfaces.
\ingroup technology-apis

The QtLocation API provides location positioning, mapping, navigation and place search via QML
and C++ interfaces.

\section1 Overview

QtLocation is split into three core sub-modules, which each have QML and C++
APIs.

\section3 Positioning
Positioning includes all the functionality necessary to find and work with geographic
coordinates, including working out the user's current position on the Earth's surface
using GPS, GLONASS, or other available services.

    \li Positioning introduction & overview:
    \li \l{location-positioning-qml.html}{for QML}
    \li \l{location-positioning-cpp.html}{for C++}
\endtable

\section3 Places
Places is
the natural complement to Positioning, providing a source of geographic
data about places of interest (POIs). As well as providing the location,
size and other vitals about a POI, the Places API can also retrieve images,
reviews and other rich content, and integrate with platform sources of
a user's favorites.

    \li Places introduction & overview:
    \li \l{location-places-qml.html}{for QML}
    \li \l{location-places-cpp.html}{for C++}
\endtable

\section3 Maps & Navigation
Maps & Navigation provides QtQuick user
interface elements for displaying geographic information on a map, as
well as allowing user interaction with map objects and the display itself.
It also contains utilities for geocoding (finding a geographic coordinate
from a street address) and navigation (including driving and walking
directions).
