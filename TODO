The following tasks need to be done once backwards compatibility
towards Mobilty's QtLocation is somewhat less of an issue.

- Remove qmobilityglobal.h
- Remove qlatin1constant.h (possible condidate for Qt)
- Remove qmobilitypluginsearch.h (convert to QFactoryLoader)
- Remove any occurance of QTM_* defines and associated QtMobility namespace
